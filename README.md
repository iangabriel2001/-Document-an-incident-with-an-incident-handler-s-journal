Incident Handler’s Journal – Ransomware Attack Scenario
📌 Activity Overview
In this activity, the task was to review a simulated ransomware security incident at a small U.S. healthcare clinic and document it using the Incident Handler’s Journal.
The journal captures essential incident details using the 5 W’s framework, along with tools used and any additional notes.
This exercise emphasizes the importance of thorough documentation in the Incident Response (IR) process, which ensures accurate reporting, facilitates effective communication between stakeholders, and provides a historical reference for future security events.

By the end of this course, multiple incident entries will be compiled into a professional reference document suitable for inclusion in a cybersecurity portfolio to showcase documentation and analytical skills to potential employers.

🏥 Scenario Summary
A small healthcare clinic specializing in primary-care services experienced a ransomware attack that disrupted operations. The ransomware was deployed through a targeted phishing campaign, encrypting critical files and displaying a ransom note demanding payment for a decryption key.

🛠 Tools Used
Email security tools (for identifying phishing messages)

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) (for identifying, isolating, and investigating infected endpoints)

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) (for log analysis and timeline building)

Backup and Recovery tools (for restoring from clean backups)

Digital Forensics utilities (to collect and preserve evidence)

📋 5 W’s of the Incident
Who caused the incident?
An organized cybercriminal group known for targeting healthcare and transportation industries.

What happened?
Phishing emails containing malicious attachments were sent to employees. Once opened, the attachment installed malware that allowed attackers to deploy ransomware, encrypting patient records and operational files.

When did the incident occur?
Tuesday morning, approximately 9:00 a.m.

Where did the incident happen?
Within the clinic’s internal network — specifically on endpoints and systems used for accessing patient medical records and critical applications.

Why did the incident happen?
The attackers exploited human vulnerability through phishing and leveraged the lack of sufficient email filtering, security awareness training, and possibly network segmentation.

📝 Additional Notes
The incident forced the clinic to shut down computer systems, halting operations.

Immediate responses included contacting law enforcement, cybersecurity professionals, and initiating technical assistance.

HIPAA compliance requires breach reporting and patient notification due to the potential exposure of Protected Health Information (PHI).

This incident highlights the importance of:

Regular phishing awareness training

Strong endpoint security

Segregated backups and recovery plans

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical systems

📚 Key Learning Points
Documentation is critical — Accurate incident records help coordinate IR efforts and assist in post-incident reviews.

Human factors remain a major attack vector — Phishing continues to be one of the top entry points for ransomware attacks.

Preparedness matters — Having an updated IR plan and tested backups can significantly reduce downtime and data loss.

Healthcare organizations are prime ransomware targets due to their reliance on immediate data access and regulatory obligations.
